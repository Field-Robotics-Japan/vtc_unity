First Person AIO is an Open Source first person controller for the Unity Engine. It offers many customization options while still being beginner friendly and easy to set up.
The Code and Prefab included are free to use in both commercial and non-commercial applications.*

- Dynamic Head bobbing

NOTICE:
    - If something isn't working right away, I encourage you to look through all the documentation, if this doesn't solve your issue please feel free to contact me at 'support@.aedangraves.info'
    - The Demo Scene included in the package contains audio assets not created or owned by me, and thus are not to be used for commercial applications.
    - The Shader Asset 'Bumped Glass' is a modified asset from the "Standard Assets" package and is not owned by me, thus is not to be used for commercial applications.
    - * All other assets in the Demo Scene were originally created by Aedan Graves and are free to use in non-commercial applications only.
    - if you've added a feature that you think should be added to the package, email the modified script with a change log entry on the top of the script to 'modifiedassets@aedangraves.info' . I will review the changes and update the package.

    
And of course, have fun! ~ Aedan Graves
